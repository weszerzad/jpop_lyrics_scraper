WELCOME TO JPOP LYRICS SCRAPER!


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This is a script to pull all songs' lyrics with their translations (if available) of a Japanese artist from jpopasia.com to your email address. Each email will contain the song's lyric (in kanji) and its translation in English.

WHY USE THIS SCRIPT?

This script is ideal if you want to learn songs' lyrics of a Japanese artist you are following, because all of their lyrics (in kanji) along with possilbe translations will be sent to your email, ready to be looked up whenever you want, even when offline, providing you use an email client that saves emails locally on your device (like a smartphone).
So that the next time you hear a song from that Japanese artist, you can search for the lyric directly in your inbox, saving you time and effort looking up online. Furthermore, you can manipulate the lyric just like a regular email (eg. mark as read, mark as unread, flag, star, move to folders, forward to your friends, etc.), which makes organizing your favourite Jpop artist's lyrics collections, sharing songs' lyrics, and many more actions become a convenient task.

There is also a excel file contains all the lyrics of an artist after scraping.

In short, with Jpop Lyric Scraper, you can save hundreds of Japanese songs lyrics for later use, in just a few minutes.
